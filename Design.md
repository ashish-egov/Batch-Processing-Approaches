## **Kafka-Based Batch Processing: Approaches and Trade-offs**

### **Objective:**

Efficiently process data in batches using Kafka, ensure all entities are successfully created, and mark the entire process as either **completed** or **failed**.

---

### **🔁 Approach 1: Complex – Batch Table with Multi-Pod Kafka Coordination**

**Workflow:**

1. Maintain a **batch table** in the database.
2. Each Kafka pod processes one or more **batches** (e.g., batch 1, batch 2, etc.).
3. After processing a batch:

   * Mark the batch as **completed** in the batch table.
4. After every batch completion:

   * Check if the **current batch is the last one**.
   * If yes:

     * Perform a **database-wide check** to verify if all required entities have been created.
     * If all entities are present → mark the **whole process as completed**.
     * If any entity is missing or in a failed state → mark the **process as failed**.

**Pros:**

* Fully utilizes **Kafka’s multi-pod** parallelism.
* Fine-grained **tracking of batch-level status**.

**Cons:**

* **Concurrency issues** need careful handling (race conditions, partial writes, etc.).
* **Complex design** involving batch metadata and sync checks.

### **⏳ Approach 2: Moderate Complexity – Await & Periodic DB Polling**

**Workflow:**

1. Skip batch table tracking.
2. Use a **coordinator function** that:

   * Periodically **polls the database every 20 seconds**.
   * Verifies the creation status of all required data entities.
3. Completion logic:

   * If **any entity is in a failed state** → mark the **process as failed**.
   * If **all entities are successfully created** → mark the **process as completed**.

**Pros:**

* Avoids batch tracking and concurrency handling.
* Works with multiple Kafka pods.

**Cons:**

* Depends on **polling intervals**, which can delay final status.
* Still needs entity-level failure tracking in the DB.

### **🧾 Approach 3: Least Complex – Single Pod, Loop-Based Execution**

**Workflow:**

1. Disable Kafka’s multi-pod distribution.
2. Process the entire dataset **sequentially in a loop** within a single pod.
3. After all entity creation operations:

   * If all are successful → mark the **process as completed**.
   * If any fails → mark the **process as failed**.

**Pros:**

* **Very easy** to implement and test.
* **No concurrency issues**.
* **No need for batch table or polling logic**.

**Cons:**

* **No parallelism** – doesn’t utilize Kafka’s distributed nature.
