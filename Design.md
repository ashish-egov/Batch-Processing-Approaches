## **Kafka-Based Batch Processing: Approaches and Trade-offs**

### **🎯 Objective:**

Efficiently process data in batches using Kafka, ensure all entities are successfully created, and mark the entire process as either **completed** or **failed**.

---

### 🔁 **Approach 1: Complex – Batch Table with Multi-Pod Kafka Coordination**

#### **Workflow:**

1. Maintain a **batch table** in the database.
2. Each Kafka **pod** processes one or more **batches** (e.g., batch 1, batch 2, etc.).
3. After processing a batch:

   * Mark the **batch as completed** in the batch table.
4. After batch completion:

   * Check if the **current batch is the last batch** (based on total batch count or metadata).
   * If **yes**:

     * Perform a **full DB check** to ensure all required entities have been created.
     * If all entities exist → mark the **process as completed**.
     * If any entity is failed/missing → mark the **process as failed**.

#### **⚠️ Race Condition Example:**

* Suppose the **last two batches (e.g., batch 9 and batch 10)** are being processed **simultaneously** by two different Kafka pods.
* **Batch 9** finishes first and marks itself as completed.
* **Batch 10** finishes right after and checks the DB to determine if it's the **last batch**.
* However, **batch 9’s completion is still not persisted in the DB** due to a slight delay.
* So **batch 10 mistakenly assumes** it is **not the last batch** (since batch 9 isn't marked as completed yet).
* **Result:** No pod triggers the **final entity validation** and **process completion** logic.
* This causes the process to hang in an incomplete state unless handled with extra synchronization or retries.

#### **✅ Pros:**

* Fully utilizes **Kafka’s multi-pod parallelism**.
* Fine-grained **tracking of individual batches**.

#### **❌ Cons:**

* Requires **complex concurrency handling**.
* Vulnerable to **race conditions** as described above.
* Involves additional **sync-checking logic** and DB dependencies.

### ⏳ **Approach 2: Moderate Complexity – Await & Periodic DB Polling**

#### **Workflow:**

1. **No batch table tracking** involved.
2. A **coordinator function**:

   * Periodically **polls the database** (e.g., every 20 seconds).
   * Checks whether **all required entities** are present and their status.
3. Completion logic:

   * If **any entity is in a failed state** → mark the **process as failed**.
   * If **all entities are successfully created** → mark the **process as completed**.

#### **✅ Pros:**

* No need for batch metadata or concurrency handling.
* Still supports **multiple Kafka pods**.

#### **❌ Cons:**

* Relies on **polling**, which can delay detection.
* Requires tracking entity creation and **failure states** in the DB.

---

### 🧾 **Approach 3: Least Complex – Single Pod, Loop-Based Execution**

#### **Workflow:**

1. Disable Kafka’s **multi-pod distribution**.
2. Process the **entire dataset sequentially** in a single Kafka consumer or service.
3. After processing:

   * If **all entities are created successfully** → mark the **process as completed**.
   * If **any entity fails** → mark the **process as failed**.

#### **✅ Pros:**

* **Very simple** to build and test.
* **No concurrency** or synchronization problems.
* No need for polling or batch tracking.

#### **❌ Cons:**

* **No parallelism** – doesn’t use Kafka’s scaling capabilities.
* Each pod requires at least 2GB RAM for production-level throughput and reliability.
